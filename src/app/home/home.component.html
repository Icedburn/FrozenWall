      Hello, I'm William!

        <p>Geek who love hiking? Or Hiker that love tech? Completely passionate for new technologies, I like to describe
          myself as an early adopter. Hey, I had my first webpage on -2bg (before Google) and had to deal with things like
          memmaker on MS-DOS to play my games!</p>

        <p>I graduated in Electrical Engineering and had been working with lot of different techs so far, specially on
          backend, cloud and devops focused on microservices architectures. I had already had the chance to work with
          languages like C#, .NET Core, NodeJS, Python, Ruby, etc... And also some other techs like Docker, Kubernetes,
          SQL Server, Cassandra (NoSQL), RabbitMQ, SQS/SNS, AWS and GCP tools, Chef and a lot of other things (did I
          mention my new go GoLang passion?).</p>

        <p>So, I decided to build this page as a small portfolio for personal projects. Here you will find some cool
          projects (for fun or to study) that I do when I'm not working, playing video games or hiking =] I really hope
          that you enjoy it!</p>

        <p>In case of any question, please fell free to contact me in one of my networks or my personal e-mail! Ps.: You
          may also see some of my projects signed as <i>"Iced"</i> or <i>"Icedburn"</i> that is my nicknames in some games and places.
